Health has always remained one of the primary concern of human being and with the help of past records available it is possible to create
a system that can analyze the data, examine and evaluate the data about epidemiology, diseases burden, clinical trials being generated
throughout the country. Hence for this purpose, I developed a system named SHUSHRUTA. SHUSHRUTA allows to analyze the clinical
test as well as patient records and can predict the disease with given test report. It also provides an overall analysis of the data available.Several tactics used in the methodology includes data cleaning, data pre-processing, feature extraction and classification.
